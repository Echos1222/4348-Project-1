I know that the project is about encrypting strings and that there will be three programs. The first program is the driver that prompts the user for everything. There will be an encryption program that encrypts and decrypts strings. Lastly a logger program that tracks what has been done. My plan is to work on the logger first since it seems the most simple since it is just writing to a file in a specific format. After that I will work on the encryption and this will most likely take the longest. Will start the logger later in the day.

Messed up last session and forgot to committ so comitted the devlog from yesterday. The goal for this session is to be able to get the logger mostly working at least for formatting and writing to a file. If possible I will complete the logger program in one sitting but might not be the case.
10/18/2025 11:35 AM Worked on the logger and was able to successfully match the format and write it to a file. Still need to work on the very first message for starting a log and the last message when the logging is done. Also I should probably make it a seperate method since right now it is in my while loop and the way my formatting is right now it is hard to implement the log start and end since my variables are defined in the try catch statements. I accomplished my goals in that I know how to format it and how to write it to a file mostly. Next session I will implement that method so that I can cleanly log the start and end messages. And I will start on my encryption program in the next session. I might also just straight up change where I define my variables and just hardcode the start and end messages so no method required we will see.

Think im gonna just add my format and writing to file logic before my loop as soon as I start writing and just have it paste the first message and do the same thing when it ends and my log file will be done. Not sure how to do the cypher so will look up the logic and test how to implement it. Going to use similiar logic to find what command the user wants to do and will have three methods for each encryption. The plan for today is to move around my Logger program to make sure it works for first and last entry and have the logger program done with. Next part is to implement in the Encryption program the reading the command and choosing what to do logic. Gonna implement setting the passkey and the branches for encrypting and decrypt.

Did not accomplish my goals for the session since I have to end the session early. Did at least accomplish completely finishing my logger program and ended up not going the method route. Next session will begin work on the encryption program and I plan to complete it since my next session will be longer.
